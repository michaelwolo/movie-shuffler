# Movie Shuffler

[Movie Shuffler](http://movieshuffler.com) provides movie suggestions based on selected content keywords.

This repository contains two client-side implementations of the application. Movie Shuffler is built with both vanilla JavaScript and AngularJS. The AngularJS implementation lacks full functionality as it is a work in progress.
