# Movie Shuffler

[Movie Shuffler](http://movieshuffler.com) provides movie suggestions based on selected content keywords.

Movie Shuffler uses PHP and MySQL on the server to store, retrieve and suggest movies and their data. APIs from both Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube are used to populate movie data.

This repository contains two client-side implementations of the application. Movie Shuffler is built with both vanilla JavaScript and AngularJS. Currently, user-generated movie submissions are not available through AngularJS version.
